# Introducing Local Contact Tracing

All COVID-19 is local.

LCT is one community's attempt to reopen our local economy witout reopening the local pandemic here in Sisters, Oregon. LCT is designed to be replicated for your community if you want to join the fight.

## Working the network

LCT depends on the network effect so the tool to beat the virus replicates at least as quickly as the virus does.

If one of us tests positive, we want everybody we shared space with to get tested. If they test positive, they warn everybody they shared space with.

Now we can reduce the time to act against the virus to the time it takes to get tested. And with the advent of reliable home test kits, this time interval approaches zero.

## What if only a few of us use LCT?

At the very least, if you use LCT to track your travels, and if you test positive, you will be able to tell the human contact tracer where you've been in the last two weeks. This minimizes the time manual contact tracing can happen.

## The Point

LCT differs from other contact tracing strategies in fundamental ways.

> But the most fundamental difference is that we don't use LCT for ourselves. We use it for the benefit of our community.

Conventional manual contact tracing starts after you test positive. LCT starts while you are healthy and moving about your daily business.

The means that if you participate in the effort to crush the virus in your community but you never get sick, your presence in the network enables those who are infected to know about it as soon as possible. This means less chance for community spread, and better chances for you to survive the disease if you get infected.

## Working the App

First up: onboard LCT. Send your browser to the `LCT web site` for your community, and provide a nickname or other identifier to personalize the app.

Second step: Go to the `Spaces` view, and enter the name of the place you want to visit. Then click the Log Visit: button.

Third step: Use the `Recent` view to reselect a public space you visit often.

> Add the app to your Home screen so you can log back onto the network quickly.

## Rapid Response

If someone test positive, they will press the `Warning` button at the top of their screen. Then they will go into quarantine.

All LCT users will see a warning message when anybody sends an `Exposure Warning`. This gives us all some idea of the prevalnce of the virus in our communnity.

If you shared space with that person, and you have the LCT app open on your phone, you will see an red `Exposure Alert` appear in LCT. Get tested, and if positive, repeat the steps above.

The virus has no chance of survival in a fully functional LCT community.

When all communities are fully functional LCT communities, the virus won't have a chance on the whole planet.

Let's do this.
