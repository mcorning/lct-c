# LCT-C Debugging Guide

Where and how you start a debugging session can make a difference to how you see debug output. If you use a Terminal View (see below), you will not see collapsed console groups; you will see all the data at once. This can be hard to follow with high data volume.

You have several ways to launch LCT-C debugging sessions for Vue and Node simultaneously in VSCode.

## Configuration

## Launch Debugger

### From Debug Extension

### From Javascript Debug Terminal
