# LCT in Action

This short video illustrates the steps outlined in the LCT documentation (see the link below).

## OBX

This is the screen you see out of the box.

1. Enter some identifier to personalize LCT.
2. Confirm your identifier (or abandon if necessary)

## Recent View

Since you have not used LCT yet, you won't see any places listed in the `Recent` view.

## Spaces View

So go the `Spaces` view, instead.

From here:

1. Type in the place you want to visit (let's go get coffee at Fika downtown)
2. Then Log your visit with the server.

### Logs

The log of your visits is stored on your device. If you need to convey this information to a human contact tracer, 

1. Click the log button in the lower right corner of the app
2. Send that person a screenshot of your log.

## Second User

Let's add another user. This time we will use an anonymous identifier.

Now let's say they too visited Fika.

## Warning Sent

OK, what if one of them tests positive in the next ten days?

They:

1. open LCT and
2. hit the Warning button.
3. go into quarantine.

They won't need LCT again until they recover. But even then, to minimize community spread they still need to use LCT.

## Positive Warnings

The exposed visitor will see two messages appear in LCT.

LCT sends the first orange `warning` message to *all* users. This gives everybody an idea of the prevalence of the virus in their community.

## Exposure Alerts

LCT sends an red `Exposure Alert` message to any visitor who shared space with the visitor who sent the warning.

If each of those visitors tests positive, they repeat the same steps: warn others and quarantine.

## The End (of the virus)

That's all there is to it.

So let's just do it...

### Thanks for watching.
